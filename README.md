# Makerchip
<p>
 Makerchip is a free web-based IDE as well as available as makerchip-app, a virtual desktop application for developing high-quality integrated circuits. You can code, compile, simulate, and debug Verilog designs, all from your browser. Your code, block diagrams, and waveforms are tightly integrated. Makerchip supports the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog standard. Transaction-Level Verilog, or TL-Verilog, represents a huge step forward, by eliminating the need for the legacy language features of Verilog and by introducing simpler syntax. At the same time, TL-Verilog adds powerful constructs for pipelines and transactions. More details about TL-Verilog: https://www.redwoodeda.com/tl-verilog
